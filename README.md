# Tic-Tac-Toe
# Board Game
# Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a 3x3 grid where two players, X and O, take turns to mark the cells. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a tie. The game also includes a restart button to reset the board and start a new game.
